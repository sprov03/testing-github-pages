# Configuration

The configuration file for Akceli is ```config/akceli.php```

## Environment Check
This is what the initial part of ```config/akceli.php``` looks like.

``` php 
<?php

use Akceli\Akceli;
use Akceli\Console;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

/**
 * This is here to prevent this from running in production
 */
if (env('APP_ENV') !== 'local') {
    return [];
}
```

::: warning
This set to prevent the Akceli Generators from being active in production.  Do not remove this, you would not want 
Akceli Generators to be active in a production application.  It requires terminal access to work but better safe then sorry.

## Settings

``` php
<?php

return [
    /**
     * Model Directory
     *
     *      Akceli has two ways that it can find a file Model
     *
     *          First:  Akceli will try to find a file with the $table attribute set to the same as your model.
     *                  If that property is set, you will have no issues finding the correct file for your model.
     *
     *          Second: If the first lookup fails, Akceli will try to find a file with the Laravel naming conventions for the table,
     *                  This can cause it to find a file that is not a model.  If all of your files are in a model directory
     *                  Or you do not have Multiple Classes that are the same name as the Expected Model, then there will be no issues
     *                  finding the correct file.
     *
     *          Note:  The possible failures of the second lookup is why Akceli models get generated with the $table property set.
     *                 If your app uses the Models directory, I suggest you set it here.  It will speed up the Model lookups.
     *                 To Insure that the model lookups always resolve correctly simply add the $table attribute to the models.
