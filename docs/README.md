# Intro

Akceli is a private composer package, that can be installed directly into a Laravel project and Akcelerate your development.

## How It Works

Akceli is powered by the same templating engine that is used by Blade.  The templates are published into your project
during the installation process.  You have full control over the templates, allowing for custom generated code defined by you.
The build in prompter will allow you to communicate with yourself in the future to remind yourself or someone else about
the details that can easily be forgotten, requiring time to read threw documentation to find some tiny little thing that you
read about six months ago, that your app now depends on.
